Smart Crop Diagnosis: Deep Learning Approach for Agricultural Disease Detection

For our project, we worked with a dataset consisting of images of cucumber plants and cucumber leaves, which were categorized into four classes: diseased cucumber plant, fresh cucumber plant, diseased cucumber leaf, and fresh cucumber leaf. The dataset was organized into three folders: train_, val_, and test_. The train_ folder was utilized for training our model, while the val_ folder served for validation purposes. To augment our training data, we employed the ImageDataGenerator module, which allowed us to generate additional training samples by applying various transformations such as rotation, width shift, height shift, shear, zoom, and flip to the images in the training class. However, we did not apply any data augmentation techniques to the val_ class images, as their purpose was solely to validate the performance of the trained model. Instead, we rescaled the val_ class images. The project achieved a validation accuracy of 94% using the InceptionV3 transfer learning model for identifying crop diseases in agriculture. You can refer the GitHub repository for the code implementation.
